LP/Q models work best
JTLS Test.oct doesn't work (sad!) from V2 when I attempted to import bones (my dumbass thought bones were stored in the wrong spot!)
HP/Q models are of Jeff The Land Shark! I love him too much to not try and import him!
UV stuff is nearly there, .TBODY of a LQ/P Superman was ALMOST aligned
