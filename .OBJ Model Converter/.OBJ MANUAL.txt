python objConverterV3.py <yourmodel>.obj
Add --extended for debug info

V3 Notes:
LP/Q models work best
JTLS Test.oct doesn't work (sad!) from V2 when I attempted to import bones (my dumbass thought bones were stored in the wrong spot!)
HP/Q models are of Jeff The Land Shark! I love him too much to not try and import him!
UV stuff is nearly there, .TBODY of a LQ/P Superman was ALMOST aligned

V4 Notes:

Added a mockup .OCT creator. Nowhere near done
If you uncomment it and use it, it's your fault


YOU MUST RE-ENCRYPT THE PROVIDED BONELESS .OCT WITH C2DITOOLS ONCE YOU HAVE EDITIED IT! SEARCH FOR "EDIT ME" FOR THE LINES TO EDIT!
INSTALL NUMPY!!!

V5 Notes:

.OCT Creator works now lol.

PLEASE RE-ENCRYPT THE NEW .OCT WITH C2DITOOLS!!! IT DOESN'T WORK DECRYPTED!!
YOU CAN GO BACK IN THE OUTPUTTED .OCT AND EDIT IT IF YOU WISH! JUST NOT AFTER RE-ENCRYPTION
INSTALL NUMPY!!!
